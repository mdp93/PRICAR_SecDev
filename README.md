# PRICAR

This repository consists of two directories, "OpenIVN" and "PrivacyCheck".

## OpenIVN

OpenIVN is a fork of the backend of the DETROIT framework. The paper can be found [here](https://mpese.com/publication/detroit/SECON_DETROIT_Paper.pdf) and the code [here](https://github.com/detroit-framework). The forked backend repository allows to spin Docker containers for third-party apps that can be run on a neutral entity (i.e., Cloud Computing Provider). Refer to README.md of OpenIVN for installation instructions.

## PrivacyCheck

PrivacyCheck consists of the processed output data from the driver score and fingerprinting scripts, code for EBD and CPD, as well as evaluation data.
